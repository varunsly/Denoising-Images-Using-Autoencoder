# Denoising-Images-Using-Autoencoder
Using Autoencoders to reconstruct a image and denoise the image

## About
Here, Firstly Autoencoder is used to recreate the input i.e Image is being taken as input and the autoencoder tries to recreate the same image as output

After, this Autoencoder is used to remove the noise that is being introduced in the dataset with the help of Gaussian Noise
